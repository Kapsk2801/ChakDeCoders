# Skill Swap Platform – Odoo Hackathon 2025

A full-stack web platform that enables users to **list skills they offer**, find others with complementary skills, and **initiate swap requests**. Built for collaborative learning and peer-to-peer upskilling — without the need for payment.

---

## Problem Statement

Develop a **Skill Swap Platform** — a mini-application that enables users to:

- Create a profile with name, photo (optional), location (optional), and availability
- List **skills they can offer** and **skills they want to learn**
- Browse **public profiles** by skill
- Send and respond to **swap requests**
- Leave **ratings and feedback** after a skill exchange

The platform should also support optional admin features like content moderation and user banning.
